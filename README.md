🚀 What I Built
Created a unified fact table combining orders, customers, payments, reviews, and delivery times.
Engineered key metrics: total item value, total payment, delivery delay days, review scores, category revenue, state-level sales.
Cleaned, validated, and exported final dataset using Python (Pandas).
Designed a dark-mode Tableau dashboard with KPIs, category insights, geolocation analysis, delay distribution, and customer satisfaction.
Delivered actionable product/operations insights (see below).

🔑 Key Insights from the Analysis
São Paulo generates ~35 percent of total marketplace revenue.
Electronics, computers, and appliances lead in total sales.
84 percent of orders arrive on time, but late deliveries significantly reduce review scores.
Average customer review score: 4.05
Delay distribution shows most delays between 1–10 days, with spikes around holidays.
